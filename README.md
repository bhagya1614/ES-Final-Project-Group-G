<h2>Introduction of the company</h2>
<p>We have selected an organization related to the agriculture field for our system development. 
We chose the plant nursery named “Uyanwaththa Plant Nursery” located in Bandaragama. It is a 
middle-sized business. Uyanwaththa plant nursery is a private individual business. It is basically 
an organization established with the purpose of making profit and in order to make profit they 
sell plants and sell their own products like fertilizer related to agriculture field. Its owner is Mr. 
K.D Udaya Perera and about 17 employees work there. They have two sub-branches in 
NuwaraEliya and Embilipitiya and plants are made in those subbranches and brought to this 
Uyanwaththa plant nursery.<p>

<h2>Introduction of stock management system</h2>
<p>After getting a clear understanding of all the issues mentioned above, we decided that a stock 
management system is the most suitable thing for this process in this company. So we have 
created this stock management system completely as a desktop-based application. <br><br>
• Our main purpose of creating a system application like this was to provide a solution to 
all the above problems with a single system. Also, we wanted to create a stock 
management system that would make it easy for the owner to have a clear understanding 
of all the stock in their nursery at any time. <br>
• This stock application is completely based on the information related to counting and 
managing the stock of plants in their plant nursery and controlling the stock. Also, we 
hope here to create this so that in addition to the related details available in a normal 
stock management system, the information of the employees working in the company 
can be deleted, updated and displayed. Also, we hope that this system will enable the 
owner to get the number of the total number of plants that he currently has and the 
number of total number of plants that have been sold.<br>
• And finally, we hope to initiate a certain person as a manager to log in to this system and 
give him the username and password needed to log in, and through that to provide the 
necessary space for him to control the affairs of the system.<br> <p>
