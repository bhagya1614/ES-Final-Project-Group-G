<h2>Introduction of the company</h2>
<p>We have selected an organization related to the agriculture field for our system development. We chose the plant nursery named “Uyanwaththa Plant Nursery” located in Bandaragama. It is a middle-sized business. Uyanwaththa Plant Nursery is a private individual business. It is basically an organization established with the purpose of making a profit and in order to make a profit they sell plants and sell their own products like fertilizer related to the agriculture field. Its owner is Mr. K.D. Udaya Perera and about 17 employees work there. They have two sub-branches in Nuwara Eliya and Embilipitiya and plants are made in those subbranches and brought to this Uyanwaththa plant nursery.<p>

<h2>Introduction of stock management system</h2>
<p>After getting a clear understanding of all the issues mentioned above, we decided that a stock management system is the most suitable thing for this process in this company. So we have created this stock management system completely as a desktop-based application. <br><br>
• Our main purpose in creating a system application like this was to provide a solution to all the above problems with a single system. Also, we wanted to create a stock management system that would make it easy for the owner to have a clear understanding 
of all the stock in their nursery at any time. <br>
• This stock application is completely based on the information related to counting and managing the stock of plants in their plant nursery and controlling the stock. Also, we hope here to create this so that in addition to the related details available in a normal stock management system, the information of the employees working in the company can be deleted, updated and displayed. Also, we hope that this system will enable the owner to get the number of the total number of plants that he currently has and the number of total number of plants that have been sold.<br>
• And Finally, we hope to initiate a certain person as a manager to log in to this system and give him the username and password needed to log in, and through that to provide the necessary space for him to control the affairs of the system.<br> <p>
